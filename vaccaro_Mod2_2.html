    <h2>Chapter 2: The starting section</h2>

    <!--My intro - first paragraph -->
    <p class="intro">I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. It's a beautiful city with a rich history and lots to do.
      <span class="sentence">One of my favorite hobbies is playing chess,</span> which I learned from my grandfather
      when I was a kid. He was a great mentor and teacher who taught me a lot about the game and life.
    </p>

    <!-- second paragraph -->
    <p>I have a funny childhood story that my family likes to tell. When I was four years old, I was playing
      chess with my younger sister. My opponents never won me!</p>

    <!--  third paragraph -->
    <p>Speaking of family, there are four of us in mine. My dad is a software engineer and my mom is a teacher. They've
      been married for over 22 years and are still going happy. My sister is two years younger than me and is currently
      studying to become a bussinesswoman.</p>

    <!-- fourth paragraph -->
    <p>Overall, I'm excited to study at university and meet new friends, teachers. I'm looking forward to meeting more
      people, expanding my network and getting exposed to more opportunities. Thank you so much for reading my blog!</p>
